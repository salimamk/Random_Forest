# Random_Forest
This repository applies machine learning techniques to predict log-salary using the Hitters dataset from the ISLR2 package in R. It covers data preprocessing, applying bagging, random forests, and boosting models, evaluating their performance with MSE, and analyzing feature importance with Random Forest.
